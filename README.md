## üìñ Description

Recently, there have been explorations of generalist segmentation models that can effectively tackle a variety of image segmentation tasks within a unified in-context learning framework. 
However, these methods still struggle with task ambiguity in in-context segmentation, as not all in-context examples can accurately convey the task information. 
In order to address this issue, we present SINE, a simple image **S**egmentation framework utilizing **in**-context **e**xamples. 
Our approach leverages a Transformer encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder provides high-quality image representations, and the decoder is designed to yield multiple task-specific output masks to effectively eliminate task ambiguity.
